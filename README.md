## GraphQL Queries and Mutations

- **Developer Queries**:

  - Fetch all Developers

    ```graphql
    query {
      developers {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        location
        experience
        hourlyRate
        skillset
        bio
      }
    }
    ```

  - Fetch a single Developer by ID

    ```graphql
    query ($id: ID!) {
      developer(id: $id) {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        location
        experience
        hourlyRate
        skillset
        bio
      }
    }
    ```

- **Developer Mutations**

  - Add a new Developer

    ```graphql
    mutation ($input: DeveloperInput!) {
      addDeveloper(input: $input) {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        location
        experience
        hourlyRate
        skillset
        bio
      }
    }
    ```

  - Update an existing Developer

    ```graphql
    mutation ($id: ID!, $input: DeveloperUpdateInput!) {
      updateDeveloper(id: $id, input: $input) {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        location
        experience
        hourlyRate
        skillset
        bio
      }
    }
    ```

  - Delete a Developer

    ```graphql
    mutation ($id: ID!) {
      deleteDeveloper(id: $id) {
        success
        message
      }
    }
    ```

---

## Usage

- Once the server is running, use Insomnia or any GraphQL client to test the GraphQL Queries and Mutations at the base URL: http://localhost:3001

- Use the above Developer Queries and Mutations to:

  - Create
  - Read
  - Update
  - Delete

- Example Developer Object JSON:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "example",
    "firstName": "Ian",
    "lastName": "Ferguson",
    "location": "Phoenix, AZ",
    "experience": "20 Years",
    "hourlyRate": "$125",
    "skillset": ["html", "JavaScript", "etc."],
    "bio": "ðŸ‘‹ Full-stack developer with 20+ years in automotive and medical industries, focused on building efficient, user-centered web applications."
  }
  ```
